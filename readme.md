## AltTab coding challenge

Here is my implementation of your test case. All comments which needed here (from my point of view) placed within code

But one thing is confusing to me - why do you divide /app_client and /public? Main task is writing backend part - so I just add /lib to /app_client but I still want to know why :)

**Hope to hear from you soon!**
